This assignment covers Sections 2.6-2.7 and Chapter 3 in the Utts and Heckard text and is designed to address the following learning objectives:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item To understand outliers and how to quantify them
\item To understand the interpretation of standard deviation in general, and also in the context of bell-shaped distributions
\item To understand the basic principles involved with simple linear regression
\item To correctly interpret scatterplots and infer general characteristics of relationships between two quantitative variables with them
\item To reinforce the interpretations of regression equations (slopes and intercepts), correlations and $R^2$ values
\item To understand when and how regression can be used (to avoid pitfalls like extrapolation, trying to infer causal relationships, and using it to summarize non-linear relationships)
\end{itemize}
