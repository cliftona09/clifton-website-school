#1f - you wrote (-2,3), but you meant (-2,2) for the last part.

#1f - for *z-scores*, 68% are between +/-1, and 95% are between +/-2.  You used the original units, not on the z-score scale.


#2c - you only went +/- 1 sd.  You need to go +/- 2 sds for 95%


#2d - noteworthy tall outlier!


#2i - Standard deviation would change.  It measures spread, and deleting the two most outlying values decreases spread.

Median would not change, because taking one value each from the left and right of the median still leaves it directly in the middle.


#3c - use the value of the slope in the sentence.  "As a person's weight increases by one pound, we expect the time to chug a beverage to decrease by 0.06573 seconds".  Similar comment for #4c.  But for #5c - very nice!  For #5k, make sure you aren't making a definitive statement - add language like "we expect it to in/decrease" or "it in/decreases by this much on average.‚Äù




#3g - calculate the prediction with your myreg() function.  It comes out to ~ -3.11 seconds!  Finish chugging before you start!



#2a - it can be difficult to summarize shape at first.  a lot of students want to read a lot into slight deviations from perfect symmetry.  don't do this.  this is a wonderfully symmetric plot - they don't get much better than this in the wild.  Same for 2d.


#3a - you note some curvature here, which I can understand at first glance, mainly due to the heaviest person in the dataset.  It can be tricky to describe shape (e.g. shape of relationships and/or shape of distributions) at first.  I usually try not to let a single observation, as in this case, dictate the shape of an entire cloud of data.  If you gloss over this one person, it looks pretty much linear.  


#3g - what's obviously invalid?

#5e - you flipped the role of August temps and latitude in this sentence.

#5g - you're supposed to see that these are the same.

#5 R^2 - About 61% of the variation in August temps is explained by latitude.
