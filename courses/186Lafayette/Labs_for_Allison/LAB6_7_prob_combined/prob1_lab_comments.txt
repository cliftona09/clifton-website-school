#1a - these are relative freq. probs.  We ask a large number of people, and count the relative number of times a response occurs.

#1c - wanted you to describe the complementary event (1-5 rating), not calculate its probability

#1d - second part: 1-.26 = .74

#1e - they are mutually exclusive *because they cannot both happen at the same time*

#1i - they are dependent because you can see that the genders differ in their propensity to give high/low ratings.  If they were independent, the probabilities of high/low ratings wouldn’t differ by gender.

#1j - these are mutually exclusive events, so they must be dependent

#1k - they are independent because a random woman's rating doesn’t influence a random man's rating

#2c - NO!  If p<.05, it is statistically significant, so there is a relationship between gender and music preference.

#2d - 	.43005181
	.25626204
	.11823204
	.20616570
	.8842975
	.1157025 

#2d - last two should be .8842975 and .1157025 (column percents!)

#3c - discrete, yes, but countably infinite.

#6b - E(profit) = sum( c(-2,72) * c(37/38, 1/38)) = -0.05263158


#6b - interpretation: over the long run, casinos expect to make ~16 cents every time a player bets on a single number.  




LACROSSE:

Oops: #1g for females should be .42, not .32



#1k - they are independent because they don’t influence each other



#2b - you flipped male/female preferences



#3c - discrete, yes, but countably infinite.



#6b - don't divide the E(X) by 2!!!  Your answer is half of what it should be.
